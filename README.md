# Healthcare-data-analysis-
Hospital operations, quality of care, and financial performance analysis


### Problem statement

A hospital needs a unified analytics solution to understand how patient care, operational performance, and financial outcomes are connected. Key metrics such as length of stay, readmissions, department utilization, and revenue performance are currently spread across multiple systems, making it difficult for leaders to identify performance trends, capacity issues, and improvement opportunities.

This project aims to integrate clinical, admissions, and billing data into a single analytics platform and provide insights that help the hospital improve patient outcomes, optimize resource use, and strengthen financial performance.


### Project title

Hospital operations, quality of care, and financial performance analysis

### Tools used

•	MySQL: Data storage, joins, KPI queries

• Jupyter Notebook (Python): Data validation, feature engineering, EDA

• Power BI: Executive dashboards & storytelling

### STEP 1: Define Business Questions

This analysis  will answer healthcare questions such as: 

### Operational

o	What is the average length of stay (LOS) by diagnosis and department?

o Which departments are over capacity?

### Quality of care

o Which diagnoses have the highest 30-day readmission rates?

o Are outcomes improving over time?

### Financial

o What diagnoses and departments drive the most revenue?

o Where are insurance reimbursement gaps?

### STEP 2: Data Model (Healthcare-Realistic Schema)

Tables I  will create

• patients

• admissions

• diagnoses

• procedures

• billing

• providers

### STEP 3: MySQL Database Schema

##### Table 1: patients

##### Table 3: diagnoses


##### Table 4: procedures


##### Table 5: billing



##### Table 6: providers



### STEP 4: Generate synthetic healthcare data
