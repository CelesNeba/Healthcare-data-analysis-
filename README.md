Hospital operations, quality of care, and financial performance analysis


### Problem statement

A hospital needs a unified analytics solution to understand how patient care, operational performance, and financial outcomes are connected. Key metrics such as length of stay, readmissions, department utilization, and revenue performance are currently spread across multiple systems, making it difficult for leaders to identify performance trends, capacity issues, and improvement opportunities.

This project aims to integrate clinical, admissions, and billing data into a single analytics platform and provide insights that help the hospital improve patient outcomes, optimize resource use, and strengthen financial performance.
